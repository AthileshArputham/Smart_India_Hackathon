# Smart_India_Hackathon
A project that uses Deep Q-Learning to automate a simulated traffic system. The objective is to reduce the overall waiting time of vehicles at traffic lights.

The aim of this project is for a traffic light to determine the optimum time duration to cycle through traffic light phases, given the load at its junction. Each traffic light would be an agent. Given the traffic load (the number of vehicles) at each part of the junction and the current time duration, the traffic light would decide how to update the time duration. In a practical scenario, the load could be determined by cameras on top of the traffic lights, or induction loop traffic sensors.
